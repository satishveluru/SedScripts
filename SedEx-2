d - delete ; p - printed ; s- subtstitution 

1 '4,10d'
Lines starting from the 4th till the 10th are deleted/printed 

2 '10,4d'
Only 10th line is deleted, because the sed does not work in reverse direction

3 '4,+5d'
This matches line 4 in the file, deletes that line, continues to delete the next five lines, and then ceases its deletion and prints the rest

4 '2,5!d'
This deletes everything except starting from 2nd till 5th line

5 '1~3d'
This deletes the first line, steps over the next three lines, and then deletes the fourth line. Sed continues to apply this pattern until the end of the file.

6'2~2d'
This tells sed to delete the second line, step over the next line, delete the next line, and repeat until the end of the file is reached

7 '4,10p'
Lines starting from 4th till 10th are printed

8 '4,d'
This generates the syntax error

9 ',10d'
This would also generate syntax error
